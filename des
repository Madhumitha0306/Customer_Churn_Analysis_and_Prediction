Project Overview

This project analyzes customer churn in a telecommunications company to identify key factors influencing churn and predict which customers are at risk of leaving.
The ultimate goal is to provide data-driven insights and strategies to improve customer retention.

Objectives

Understand the factors contributing to churn.

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on customer demographics and service usage.

Build a machine learning model to predict churn probability.

Suggest customer retention strategies based on insights.

Dataset

File: Telco_Customer_Churn_Dataset.xlsx
Source: Telco Customer Churn dataset (commonly used for churn prediction studies).

Key Columns:

customerID: Unique ID for each customer

gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents: Demographic information

tenure: Number of months the customer has stayed

InternetService, Contract, PaymentMethod: Service details

MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges: Billing details

Churn: Whether the customer left (Yes/No)

Task 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handled missing values and data inconsistencies

Converted categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding

Cleaned data saved as Telco_Customer_Churn_Cleaned.csv
Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Calculated overall churn rate

Analyzed churn by gender, tenure, contract type, and payment method

Visualized patterns using:

Count plots

Pie charts

Distribution plots

Correlation heatmaps
Task 3: Customer Segmentation

Segmented customers by:

Tenure groups (e.g., 0–12, 12–24, 24+ months)

Monthly charges

Contract type

Compared churn rates across these segments using bar plots and histograms
Task 4: Churn Prediction Model

Developed a Logistic Regression model

Trained on features like contract type, charges, and tenure

Evaluated using:

Accuracy

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report
Task 5: Customer Retention Strategies

Identified key churn factors (short tenure, high monthly charges, month-to-month contracts)

Suggested strategies:

Offer discounts to long-term loyal customers

Introduce loyalty rewards for new users

Improve service reliability for high-paying customers

Calculated Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) to find high-value customers at churn risk
Task 6: Visualizations

Created several insightful plots:

Box Plot: Monthly Charges vs Churn

Violin Plot: Tenure vs Churn

Count Plot: Contract Type by Churn

Pair Plot: Relationships between tenure, charges, and churn

Heatmap: Correlation between numerical features

Bar Plot: Internet Service vs Churn

Key Insights

Customers on month-to-month contracts have the highest churn.

Higher monthly charges correlate strongly with churn.

Long-tenure customers are less likely to churn.

Electronic check payment method users are more prone to churn.

Results

Achieved ~80% accuracy using Logistic Regression.

Generated actionable business insights to reduce churn.

Created clear visualizations for management presentation.
Conclusion

This project successfully combines data analysis, visualization, and machine learning to understand customer behavior and predict churn.
It demonstrates how telecom companies can use data-driven approaches to retain customers, reduce losses, and increase satisfaction.
